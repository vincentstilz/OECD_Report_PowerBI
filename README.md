# PowerBI Report on OECD Well-Being Data

## Overview

This PowerBI report offers an in-depth analysis of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) Well-Being Data, covering 34 topics related to well-being and economic indicators across OECD member countries. The project aims to provide a comprehensive comparative measure of well-being, fostering a deep understanding of the dataset and extracting meaningful conclusions to empower citizens in the policy-making process.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Analysis**: Utilize PowerBI's statistical functions to explore data relationships and perform multivariate analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Create interactive dashboards for a dynamic exploration of the OECD dataset.
- **Insight Discovery**: Summarize key analytical findings and present recommendations based on data to influence policy-making.

## Dataset

The dataset, provided by the OECD in 2017, spans 34 topics relevant to societal well-being, from housing quality and affordability to health, employment, and education. It involves data aggregated by country with indicators averaged within 11 broad topics, structured and cleaned for analysis.

## Key Features of the Report

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Offering insights on economic indicators, quality of life, employment, education, and more.
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering and Analysis**: Basic feature engineering and review of dataset metadata for enhanced data understanding.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying significant relationships between different well-being and economic indicators.

## Key Findings

- Life expectancy correlates positively with GDP per capita and quality of support network but negatively with the homicide rate and dwellings without basic facilities.
- Environmental quality significantly varies among OECD countries, with South Korea and Iceland highlighted for their air pollution levels and environmental scores, respectively.
- Economic status, represented by personal earnings, shows a positive relationship with quality of life indicators such as rooms per person, water quality, safety, and life satisfaction.

## How to Use

The PowerBI report is structured into several dashboards, each focusing on different aspects of the OECD dataset:
- **Economic Indicators**: Overview and comparison of economic factors.
- **Quality of Life**: Visualization of safety, health, and environment measures.
- **Employment & Education**: Analysis of the employment and education landscape.
- **Interactive Features**: The dashboards are designed with interactivity in mind, allowing users to filter, sort, and drill down into specific data points for a personalized exploration.
